# SocketGame

A simple game using sockets in node.js. It is a simple server which enables to join users a room and communicate with each other.
<br>
Just now this is a simple chat room, but I am planning to add more features to it.
<br> Currently this is in WIP.It is a server only, so you will be communicating through the api. I will be adding a client soon.

## Images
- User 1 joins the room and creates a room

- Above images show chat between two users with system messages live events updates like user joined, user left etc.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and go to `localhost:3000`

## How to use

You will be needing api tools like postman to communicate with the server.
